						<a href=""><h1>Traditional 5x5 Lifting Program</h1></a>
						<p>This is the traditional 5x5 program created by Mark Rippetoe, its simple and powerful. This program will make sure you build a solid foundation for you to build off. This is usally recommended to beginners.</p>

						<a href=""><h1>Jonnie Candito's Linear Strength Program </h1></a>
						<p>Ideal for beginners but also for can be very useful for more experienced lifters as well. The lifting schedule is also flexible. Jonnie recommends this program to people brand new to lifting, so they can take time to learn the required form used in the 3 main lifts (Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press).</p>

						<a href=""><h1>Ice Cream Fitness 5X5 (ICF 5X5)</h1></a>
						<p>Don't mind the name, this is yet another amazing program available to everyone. I personally have used this to go from a weak 135lb guy to around 160lb in under a year when I first started. This program is more bodybuilding targeted due to the higher volume (much more workouts). Although this program usually takes 1.5 - 2 hours to complete and is not recommended for people tight on time. If you have the time, this program is incredible.</p>
